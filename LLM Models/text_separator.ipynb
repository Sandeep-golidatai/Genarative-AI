India-US ties had not lived up to their promise following a landmark civilian nuclear deal in 2005 because a liability law passed by India three years later hobbled purchase of reactors.\\n\\n\"This followed a fading commitment to the relationship during [former prime minister] Manmohan Singh\\'s second term as the leader of a coalition government. With Mr Modi there has been a lot more enthusiasm about embracing the US. Mr Biden has also given an overall broad directive to make it work,\" says Seema Sirohi, author of Friends With Benefits: The India-US Story.\\n\\nMs Sirohi says the US put in a \"lot of effort to make Mr Modi\\'s visit substantive and have a lot of deliverables\". Defence-industrial cooperation and technology topped the list. Consider this:'),\n"," Document(page_content='General Electric and India\\'s state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited will make in India advanced fighter jet engines for the country\\'s indigenous light combat aircraft. This means a \"greater transfer of US jet engine technology than ever before\" - a clear sign that Washington not only wants to sell arms to India but is also comfortable with sharing military technology.\\nIndia will proceed with a $3bn purchase of the battle-tested MQ-9B Predator drones from General Atomics, which will also set up a facility in India. The drones will be assembled in India, which fits into Mr Modi\\'s \\'Make in India\\' campaign. The US supplies only 11% of India\\'s arms - Russia is the biggest (45%) supplier - but hopes to become the primary provider in the coming years. Mr Kugelman says Washington\\'s immediate goal is to \"strengthen India\\'s military capacity to counter China\".\\nMr Modi wants to make India a semiconductor base. US memory chip giant Micron Technology will invest up to $825m to build a semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, creating thousands of jobs.\\nUS semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research will train 60,000 Indian engineers through a network of interconnected labs and research centres to speed up India\\'s semiconductor education and workforce development. Also Applied Materials, the biggest maker of machines for producing semiconductors, will invest $400m to establish an engineering centre in India.\\n\"It is all about the future now.

The response from India was measured, never overeager or too forthcoming.\\n\\nThe reason was the way India saw geopolitics and its own place in the global order. The strategy of nonalignment, started by India\\'s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, has always been deeply rooted into India\\'s foreign policy.\\n\\nIndia never wanted to be seen in one camp or the other, or to be seen as junior strategic partner to a global superpower. Mr Modi has not left the ideals of what some describe as \"strategic altruism\" in Indian foreign policy.'),\n"," Document(page_content='But Mr Modi is leading a different kind of India, one which has considerably more economic and geopolitical heft. He has owned the India-US relations - he formed close bonds with former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump and now with Mr Biden.\\n\\nBut India\\'s \"strategic autonomy\" has not been sacrificed. Washington would have wanted India to go a step further on Russia and probably take a harder public stand on China.\\n\\nBut the Biden administration didn\\'t seem disappointed as Mr Modi repeated his line that \"this was not the era of war\" without mentioning Russia. The Indian prime minister did speak about the importance of beefing up humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. He didn\\'t mention China by name either but did talk about the importance of a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.'),\n"," Document(page_content=\"This is how far Mr Modi could have pushed his administration's policy without compromising on strategic autonomy.
