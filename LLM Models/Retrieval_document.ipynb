This means that if two objects are moving with the same velocity, the one with greater mass will have more kinetic energy.Moreover, kinetic energy is also directly proportional to the square of the velocity. This implies that if you double the velocity of an object, its kinetic energy will increase four times. Similarly, if you triple the velocity, the kinetic energy will increase nine times, and so on.For example, consider a car and a truck traveling at the same speed. Even if they have the same velocity, the truck, having a larger mass, will possess more kinetic energy compared to the car.\",\n          \"A right triangle is a fundamental concept in geometry. It's a triangle that has one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees, which is called the right angle. The other two angles in a right triangle are acute angles, meaning they are less than 90 degrees.The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and it's always the longest side in a right triangle. The other two sides are called the legs of the triangle. In a right triangle, the lengths of the legs and the hypotenuse are related by the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.Right triangles have many applications in mathematics and real-world situations. They are used in trigonometry to define the trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent, which relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides. Right triangles also appear frequently in geometry, physics, engineering, and various other fields.\",\n          \"Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, composed of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in orbitals. Each element on the periodic table is characterized by the number of protons in its nucleus, known as its atomic number. The number of protons determines an element's identity.Protons carry a positive charge, while neutrons have no charge. Electrons, which are much smaller in mass than protons and neutrons, carry a negative charge and orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. These electrons are involved in chemical reactions and determine an atom's chemical properties.Atoms are electrically neutral because the number of protons (positively charged) equals the number of electrons (negatively charged). However, atoms can become ions by gaining or losing electrons, leading to a net positive or negative charge.The arrangement of electrons in atoms follows certain rules, such as the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule, which dictate how electrons occupy orbitals within energy levels.Atoms can form bonds with other atoms through various mechanisms, such as ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic bonding, to create molecules and compounds. These bonds are formed by the interactions of electrons between atoms.In summary, atoms are the basic units of matter, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons. They combine to form molecules and compounds, which are the foundation of all substances in the universe.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
